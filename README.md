# 100 Days of Code

I started [round 1](https://kellim.github.io/100-days-of-code/round1) of 100 days of code on November 4th, 2018. If you're not familiar with the challenge, check out the website [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

My goal for this challenge is to code each day for at least an hour or hopefully more. I've decided it's OK to count working on a tutorial that I need to do before starting a project. I've come to think that designing an app and researching should count as time spent on coding activities too. I'm also keeping a log with what I accomplish each day and tweet about it.
