# 100 Days of Code

## The Challenge & Rules!

I'm commiting to 100 days of code starting on Sunday November 4th, 2018. If you'd like to join the 100 days of code challenge, 
check out [this 100 Days of Code repo](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code). I created my repository from scratch, but
many people fork that repsoitory and use it for their log.

My main goal for this challenge is to make sure that I code each day for at least an hour (hopefully more) on something 
that isn't a part of a guided tutorial. I also plan to keep a log with what I accomplished each day and tweet about it.
