# 100 Days of Code

![100 Days of Code Round 1 Image](assets/images/100-days-of-code-round-1.jpg)

I started [round 1](https://kellim.github.io/100-days-of-code/round1) of 100 days of code on November 4th, 2018. If you're not familiar with the challenge, check out the website [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

My main goal for this challenge is to make sure that I code each day for at least an hour (hopefully more) on something 
that isn't a part of a guided tutorial. I also plan to keep a log with what I accomplished each day and tweet about it.
