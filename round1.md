This is my log for the [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge that I started on 11/4/18. 

## Day 1: November 4, 2018

**Progress:** Today I worked on a Testimonial carousel using Bootstrap for the [She's Coding website](http://shescoding.org/). I'm having trouble formatting it properly and made an example version on CodePen with kittens to play around with, but it's not working yet. I added two testimonials and you can see them both at the same time, but you're supposed to be able to click arrows to switch between the two. 

I also setup this 100 Days of Code Log to be on [GitHub Pages using a Jekyll theme](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/), and I customized the theme a little. The easiest theme to use for 100 Days of Code is the [leap-day](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day) theme because it will put everything with a heading in the sidebar list, so it's like a mini blog and you can still put your entire 100 Days of Code log into one markdown file.
